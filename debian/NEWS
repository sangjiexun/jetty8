jetty (6.1.21-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Stopped using /tmp/jetty-temp in /etc/init.d/jetty for security
    reasons. From now all temporary data will be stored within
    /var/cache/jetty as denoted below:
    - JVM_TMP is now /var/cache/jetty/tmp
    - JETTY_TMP is now /var/cache/jetty/data
